# Manuel Farms

## About The Project
Manuel Farms is a web based application built to cater and ease the stress of customer's who don't know where to find,
or don't have the time to source for certain food items or livestock, to be able to come to the website, search for the items 
and get them in bulk quantities, thereby shortening the gap between the farmer's and consumers without leaving the comfort of
their homes.

Manuel Farms was built using Express.js, Node.js and PostgreSQL, because they provide a fast, lightweight, and scalable way.
Express simplifies routing and middleware handling, while Node.js ensures efficient database operations with its non-blocking
architecture. Using Javascript across both backend and frontend makes development smoother.

Some features I hope to implement in the future are being able to order for the food items, livestock and also incorporate
payment systems into the web app.
